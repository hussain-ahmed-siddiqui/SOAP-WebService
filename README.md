# SOAP-WebService
 Demo Project for Soap web services to understand how SOAP webservices are served and how they are consumed by clients.

There are 2 projects(server and client)
1.Run the soapws(server) project
2.Run the csoapws(client) project
3.Type in the client application's console a country name(e.g., Spain, Poland, United-Kingdom)
=> The server will return the Country Object to the client application which is hard coded in the server.
=> To add more countries go in the CounrtyRepository class on the server.
